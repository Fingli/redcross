<!--! HOW TO !--!>
------------------
Use the .POT file in RedLine/lang as base for your translation.

1. Open the file redline.pot with PoEdit (http://poedit.net/)
2. Make your translations
3. Save the translation as .po file with correct country code as name xx_XX (Example: en_US.po). 
PoEdit will create automatically altogether .po and .mo files
4.Put your xx_XX.mo (Example: en_US.mo) file in "lang" folder in the RedLine directory
5. That's all :) 

When you finish the translation you can save, you’ll find in the project directory the files .po and .mo. The file ".mo" is the real localization file, but if you want to change the translation use the .po file, so don’t delete it.
